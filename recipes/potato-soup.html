        <li>1/3 cup of all-purpose flour (42g)</li>

        <li>2 cups milk (475ml)</li>
        <li>2/3 cup heavy cream (155ml)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoon* salt</li>

        <li>Shredded cheddar cheese, chives, and additional sour cream and bacon for topping (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bacon pieces in a large Dutch Oven or soup pot over medium heat and cook until bacon is crisp and browned.</li>
        <li>Remove bacon pieces and set aside, leaving the fat in the pot</li>
        <li>Add butter and chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onions are tender (3-5 minutes)</li>
        <li>Add garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds)</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the four over the ingredients in the pot and stir until smooth (use whisk if needed)</li>
        <li>Add diced potatoes to the pot along with chicken broth, milk, heavy cream, salt, pepper, and ancho chili powder. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil and cook until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork (about 10 minutes)</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to simmer and remove approximately half*** of the soup to a blender (be careful, it will be hot!) and puree until smooth (half is about 5 cups of soup, but just eyeballing the amount will be fine. Alternatively you can use na immersion blender).</li>
        <li>Return the pureed soup to the pot and add sour crea and reserved bacon pieces, stir well.</li>
        <li>Allow soup to simmer for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
