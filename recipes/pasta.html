    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Learn how to make pasta at home! This 4-ingredient homemade pasta recipe is easy to make, and it yields chewy, delivious noodles every time.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients List</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>All-purpose flour</strong> - In the past, I thought you needed 00 flour or semolina flour to make great fresh pasta, but this homemade pasta recipe proved me wrong. In it, regular all-purpose flour yields chewy, bouncy noodles every time.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong> - The key ingredient for adding richness and moisture to dough!</li>
        <li><strong>Olive oil</strong> - Along with the eggs, a splash of olive oil moistens the dough and helps it come together.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong> - Add it to the dough and the pasta water for the best flavor.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>First, make an est with the flour on a clean work surface.</strong> - Add the remaining ingredients to the center and use a fork to gently break up the eggs. Try to keep the flour walls intact as best you can!</li>
        <li><strong>Next, use your hands to gently mix in the flour.</strong> Continue working the dough to bring it together into a shaggy ball.</li>
        <li><strong>Then, knead!</strong> At the beginning, the dough should feel pretty dry, but stick with it! It might not feel like it's going to come together, but after 8-10 minutes of kneading, it should become cohesive and smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>When the dough comes together, shape it into a ball and wrap it in plastic wrap.</strong> Let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>After the dough rests, slice it into 4 pieces</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Use a rolling pin or your hands to gently flatten one into an oval disk.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Then, run it through the widest setting of your pasta maker</strong> - (level 1 on the KitchenAid attachment). I run the dought through the pasta maker 3 times on this setting before proceeding to the next step. If you don't have the KitchenAid attachment, roll out the dough according to your pasta maker's instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Next, fold the dough... if you wnat to.</strong> This step is somewhat optional, but it will make your final pasta sheet more rectangular, which will yield more long strands of pasta. Plus, it's super simple! Just lay the dough flag and fold both short ends in to meet in the center.</li>
        <li><strong>Then, fold it in half lengthwise to form a rectangle.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Once you've folded the dough, roll it out to your desired thickness.</strong> On my KitchenAid attachment, I run it through the pasta roller three times on levle 2, three times on level 3, and one time each on levels 4, 5, and 6.</li>
        <li><strong>Repeat these steps with remaining dough pieces.</strong> Each time you finish with a piece of dough, lay one half of it on a lightly floured baking sheet. Sprinkle the dough with flour, and fold the other half on top. Sprinkle the top with flour, too!</li>
        <li><strong>Finally, cut and cook the pasta.</strong> Run the pasta sheets through your desired pasta cutter attachment. Cook the noodles in a pot of boiling salted water for 1 minute, and enjoy!</li>
